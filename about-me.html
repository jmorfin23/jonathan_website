            Hey! If your reading this you'd probably like to know more about who I am: 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My name is Jonathan Morfin, I'm 23 years old and I'm currently living in Boston MA. I'm currently 
            attending a coding bootcamp (shoutout CodeAcademy), pursuing a career in development. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            You might be wondering why I chose to pursue developoment as a career rather than a career in the medical field,
            considering I graduated with a B.S. in Biology. One of the reasons I decided to not pursue the medical field was because I simply don't have a passion for 
            healthcare. Like anything else, if you love it, you do it, if you don't, you don't. All things are the same for 
            careers. One of my strengths is problem solving and being detail oriented. These are must-need qualities for candidates pursuing any type 
            of CS related careers. After working a few jobs in other un-related fields, I decided to choose to pursue development. I've always had an interest in it, and 
            when I was at Umass Amherst I tried to minor in CS, but was unable to due to scheduling.

            Hey hows it going, this is Jonathan, a <em>future</em> software developer born and raised in the great city of 
            Boston Massachussetts. After graduating high school, Jonathan attended the University of Massachussetts Amherst
            where he studied Biology. Upon graduating he had no idea what he wanted to pursue. On a leap of faith, he left 
            Boston to live in Nashville on his own to figure out his direction. In Nashville, Jonathan worked numerous jobs 
            and while working in leasing, he met a few software engineers. After meeting 4 sofware developers and becoming interested 
            in development as a career, he decided to move back to his home city to attend a coding bootcamp to jump-start his career. 
            Jonathan later graduated from the bootcamp. TBC.
